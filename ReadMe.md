## The <strike>Swanson</strike> Goal

I made a beautiful mockup of a Ron Swanson quote generator in Sketch. The goal is to try and turn my design prowess into an actual web app. Assets are included.

## Rules

1) **No JQuery**. I think this would be a great time to try learning how to use the JS `fetch()` API which is built into vanilla JS and usable by all the major browsers now. 

2) **Google for at least 30 minutes** before asking me a question if you are stumped. Will help build the confidence at finding answers yourself.

3) **Time yourself**. Run a stopwatch/timer while you're working on it. Stop it when you're not. Write down what you were working on and the amount of time spent when you stop in a text file or something. Also consider stopping the timer when you finish a certain task and record how long that took. For instance:

``` 
0:15 - Setting up project
0:10 - Setting up project [Done]
1:00 - Styling page [Done]
0:50 - Getting Quote API working
0:45 - Getting Quote API working 
0:15 - Getting Quote API working [Done]
```
That way when you're done we can see what was the most difficult part and can focus on similar stuff and see how your time improves.

4) **Don't get discouraged**. I intentionally put stuff in here that you don't know how to do. Having no idea what to do is not a bad thing. We need to buff up your confidence in figuring stuff out in the face of having no idea what's going on, once that happens this stuff won't be nearly as scary. 

## The API

Someone has built a server that hosts a Ron Swanson quote API, because of course. You can checkout the docs here: https://github.com/jamesseanwright/ron-swanson-quotes

## Sharing

I believe you have done a Twitter share button before, but Facebook is more involved. Remember the 30 Minute Googling rule. I'm not going to give any hints on that in this doc. Good luck! :) 

## Note
I originally had helpful links in this document but then went back and deleted them all ;) Now you can try and find the stuff yourself hehe ;)
